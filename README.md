As-Salaam everyone,

If you would like to use this app, simply open app.py and review the list of libraries used. Copy their names and search for them in the Python Package Index (PyPI) to ensure they are installed in your Python environment.
Once all required libraries are installed, run app.py to start the application.

Have a great coding time!
